## Quiz

The following questions test your knowledge in the introductory chapter of the principle
of maximum likelihood, hypothesis testing and confidence intervals and regression models.

### Question 1

Three statements about p-values are:

1. The p-value is the chance that the null hypothesis is correct.
2. The p-value is 1 minus the chance that the alternative hypothesis is correct.
3. The p-value is the chance that the data we have observed come from the null hypothesis.

```{r Q1}
quiz(
  question("Which of the following is correct?",
    answer("Statement 1 is correct, and the others wrong."),
    answer("Statement 2 is correct, and the others wrong."),
    answer("Statement 3 is correct, and the others wrong."),
    answer("Only Statements 1 and 3 are correct."),
    answer("None of the statments is correct.", correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE, random_answer_order = FALSE
  )
)
```

### Question 2

The maximum likelihood estimation methods gives us consistent estimates.
```{r Q2}
quiz(
  question("What does this mean?",
    answer("The esimates we obtain are unbiased."),
    answer("The estimates we obtain equal the true value in the population."),
    answer("The estimates we obtain comes closer to the true value in the population as the sample size increases.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The estimates we obtain are relatively close to the true value in the population."),
    allow_retry = TRUE, random_answer_order = TRUE
  )
)
```

### Question 3

```{r Q3}
quiz(
  question("What happens as sample size increases?",
    answer("P-values become smaller and confidence intervals narrower.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("P-values become larger and confidence intervals wider."),
    answer("P-values become smaller and confidence intervals wider."),
    answer("P-values become larger and confidence intervals narrower."),
    allow_retry = TRUE, random_answer_order = TRUE
  )
)
```

### Question 4

```{r Q4}
quiz(
  question("In the context of hypothesis testing for regression models, which of the following statements is correct?",
    answer("With the Wald test we can only test one coefficient at a time."),
    answer("With the likelihood ratio test we can compare nested models.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("With the score test we fit the model under the null hypothesis, and hence we can only conclude if the null is correct."),
    answer("With the Wald test we fit the model under the alternative hypothesis, and hence we can only conclude if the null hypothesis is correct."),
    allow_retry = TRUE, random_answer_order = TRUE
  )
)
```

## Exercises

The purpose of this practical is to illustrate how standard linear regression models can 
be performed in R.

The following questions are based on the PBC dataset. This dataset is available as the 
object `pbc2.id` and is already loaded in this session. From this dataset we will use the 
following variables:

- `serBilir`: baseline serum bilirubin in mg/dl.

- `drug`: the treatment indicator with values 'placebo' and 'D-penicil'.

- `age`: baseline age in years.

- `sex`: the sex indicator with values 'male' and 'female'.

- `serChol`: baseline serum cholesterol in mg/dl.

- `prothrombin`: baseline prothrombin time in sec.

### Question 1

We want to see how the log-transformed serum bilirubin time is related with the rest of 
the variables. Start by fitting an additive linear regression model, using function 
`lm()`, and interpret the results you obtain from the `summary()` method. Name the fitted 
model `fit1`.

```{r P1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 10}

```

```{r P1-hint-1}
# Linear regression models are fitted with function lm().
# As first argument you need to provide a formula of the model you want to fit.
# Specify also the 'data' argument that is the database containing the variables you
# want to use - here is 'pbc2.id'
```
```{r P1-hint-2}
# The code for the additive model is:
fit1 <- lm(log(serBilir) ~  drug + age + sex + serChol + prothrombin, 
          data = pbc2.id)

summary(fit1)
```

### Question 2

Check the residuals of model `fit1` using the `plot()` method; before calling `plot()`,
set `par(mfrow = c(2, 2))` in order to obtain the first basic plots in one figure.


```{r P2-setup}
fit1 <- lm(log(serBilir) ~  drug + age + sex + serChol + prothrombin, 
          data = pbc2.id)
```

```{r P2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 10}

```

```{r P2-hint-1}
# Just first execute par(mfrow = c(2, 2)) and the plot() of your model from the 
# previous question
```
```{r P2-hint-2}
# The code is:
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(fit1)
```

### Question 3

We believe that the association between `serBilir` and each one of `age`, `serChol` and 
`prothrombin` could be different between males and females. Extend the previous model 
`fit1` to accommodate this. Use again the `summary()` method to get a detailed output and 
interpret the results. Name the fitted model `fit2`.

```{r P3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 10}

```

```{r P3-hint-1}
# We will actually need to include the interaction terms between 'sex' and each on of
# 'age', 'serChol' and 'prothrombin'

# An interaction term between two variables is included using the ':', e.g., 'sex:age'
```
```{r P3-hint-2}
# The code is:
fit2 <- lm(log(serBilir) ~  drug + age + sex + serChol + prothrombin + 
               sex:age + sex:serChol + sex:prothrombin, 
          data = pbc2.id)

# To write exactly the same model but in a shorter syntax, we can use the '*'.
# The include both the main effects and interaction terms between the two variables.
# Hence, a shorter code is:
fit2 <- lm(log(serBilir) ~  drug + sex * (age + serChol + prothrombin), 
          data = pbc2.id)

summary(fit2)
```

### Question 4

We would like to statistically test whether the extra interaction terms really improve the
fit of the model. Using an F-test (the analogues likelihood ratio test for linear 
regression models), compare the interaction model `fit2` with the additive model `fit1`. 
In R this is done using the `anova()` function.

```{r P4-setup}
fit1 <- lm(log(serBilir) ~  drug + age + sex + serChol + prothrombin, 
          data = pbc2.id)
fit2 <- lm(log(serBilir) ~  drug + sex * (age + serChol + prothrombin), 
          data = pbc2.id)
```

```{r P4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 10}

```

```{r P4-hint-1}
# Just use the anova() function giving as arguments the two models
```
```{r P4-hint-2}
# The code is:
anova(fit1, fit2)
```

### Question 5

Given that the F-test suggests that some of the interaction terms are significant, we 
could proceed to look whether we need all of them or some of them. To find these, we could
directly look at the individual p-values from the `summary()` output of the last model 
`fit2`. However, one issue is that these p-values are not corrected for multiple testing. 
Using the `p.adjust()` function obtain the adjusted p-values.

```{r P5-setup}
fit2 <- lm(log(serBilir) ~  drug + sex * (age + serChol + prothrombin), 
          data = pbc2.id)
```

```{r P5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 10}

```

```{r P5-hint-1}
# First save the output of summary() in an object, e.g., 'summ_fit2'
```
```{r P5-hint-2}
# The code is (this code just saves the output of summary() in the object 'summ_fit2' and 
# does not produce any output):
summ_fit2 <- summary(fit2)
```
```{r P5-hint-3}
# Use function coef() to extract the coefficients' table from 'summ_fit2'
```
```{r P5-hint-4}
# The code is:
coef(summ_fit2)
```
```{r P5-hint-5}
# Hence, the p-values are in the 4th (last) column of the table. Extract the
# p-values of the interaction tersms from the table using the '[' indexing
```
```{r P5-hint-6}
# The code is:
coef(summ_fit2)[7:9, 4]
```
```{r P5-hint-7}
# Finally, give these p-values to p.adjust()
```
```{r P5-hint-8}
# The code is:
p.adjust(coef(summ_fit2)[7:9, 4])
```

### Question 6

In a second analysis, the researchers are interested in studying the relationship between
the natural logarithm of serum bilirubin and serum cholesterol corrected for age and sex.
It is believed that the relationship may be nonlinear. Use a 3rd degree polynomial of 
serum cholesterol to explore this. Name the fitted model `fit1`.

```{r P6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 10}

```

```{r P6-hint-1}
# To include in an R formula polynomials use either the I() or the poly() functions; 
# preferable is the latter. For example, to include the cubic effect of variable 'x', 
# use poly(x, 3)

# A feature when using poly() is that you need first to exlude and missing data there are
# This can be done with the complete.cases() function, e.g., data[complete.cases(data$x), ]
# removes the rows of 'data' for which 'x' is missing.

# With this information, proceed to fit the model described in the question.
```
```{r P6-hint-2}
# The code is:
fit1 <- lm(log(serBilir) ~ poly(serChol, 3) + age + sex, 
           data = pbc2.id[complete.cases(pbc2.id$serChol), ])

summary(fit1)
```

### Question 7

Investigate whether the relationship is truly nonlinear but first fitting the model that 
assumes linearity (null hypothesis), and following comparing this model with the previous 
model `fit1` (alternative hypothesis) using an F-test and the `anova()` function.

```{r P7-setup}
fit1 <- lm(log(serBilir) ~ poly(serChol, 3) + age + sex, 
           data = pbc2.id[complete.cases(pbc2.id$serChol), ])
```

```{r P7, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 10}

```

```{r P7-hint-1}
# Simply fit the linear model that contains 'serChol', 'age' and 'sex', and compare this
# with the previous model

# Note: this linear model needs to be fitted in the same version of the dataset as the 
# nonlinear model, i.e., excluding the rows with missing serum cholesterol values
```
```{r P7-hint-2}
# The code is:
fit2 <- lm(log(serBilir) ~ serChol + age + sex, 
           data = pbc2.id[complete.cases(pbc2.id$serChol), ])

anova(fit2, fit1)
```
